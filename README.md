Project Title: CNN for Image Classification

Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks using [TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch]. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset to achieve a specified accuracy.

Features
- Implemented a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- Utilizes techniques like data augmentation and dropout for regularization.
- Tracks performance metrics such as loss and accuracy over multiple epochs.
- Evaluates the model on a validation dataset and calculates the final accuracy.

 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Any other libraries used

 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
